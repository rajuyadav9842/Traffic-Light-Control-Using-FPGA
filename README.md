# Traffic-Light-Control-Using-FPGA
This project implements a traffic light controller using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array). The FPGA provides a flexible platform for implementing complex digital logic, making it suitable for efficient traffic light control.

Features:
Implements a traffic light controller with red, yellow, and green states.
Supports transitions between states based on timing and input signals (e.g., pedestrian crossing requests, vehicle sensors).
Designed using VHDL/Verilog hardware description languages.
Synthesized using Xilinx Vivado/Intel Quartus Prime.
Tested and debugged for reliability.
Optimized for resource usage and efficiency.
Deployment-ready for real-world scenarios.
